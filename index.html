    <h1>Welcome to Stephen Yoon's Website!</h1>
    <h3>
        Hello and welcome to my <em>personal</em> website!
    </h3>
    <p>
        I used to love playing mobile games like Brawl Stars and Clash Royale, but those games got
        <strong>boring</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, I want to try really <em>intense</em> games: League of Legends, Call of Duty or Valorant.
    </p>
    <h3>I play a lot of sports, including</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Football</li>
            <li>Tennis, and</li>
            <li>Volleyball</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Currently, I don't have any hobbies besides reading Korean webtoons. This is the current one I'm reading
            right now:
